# QuestionerAPI
Questioner is a mock of a meetup platform where any user is allowed to register for an account and pose questions on scheduled meetups by an admin user that he/she is interested in attending or nonetheless, comment on posted questions relating to meetups. The more a meetup question is upvoted, the more it qualifies to be objectified during the meetup. An admin user can create and delete meetups and a regular user can pose questions on posted meetups and schedule to attend the meetup if possible.
